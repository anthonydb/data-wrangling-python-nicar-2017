 2. Open up your terminal and navigate to this folder:

 ``cd Desktop/data-wrangling-python-nicar-2017``
 3. Set up your virtual environment. We'll call it 'nicar':

 ``virtualenv nicar``
 ``source nicar/bin/activate``

 4. Now you can run Jupyter Notebook:

 ``jupyter notebook``

 5. Jupyter Notebook will open up in your default browser on ``localhost:8888``. Create a new notebook with the dropdown menu on the right (python 2 or 3 should work):

 6. Now you can open up the .ipynb file in this project and paste in the code!

 7. When you're done, run ``ctrl+c`` to close Jupyter Notebook and then ``deactivate`` to exit your virtual environment.
